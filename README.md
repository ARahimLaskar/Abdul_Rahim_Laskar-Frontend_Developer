# SpaceX Capsule Explorer

Welcome to the SpaceX Capsule Explorer, a web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to explore and manage SpaceX capsule data. This comprehensive application offers a range of features, including capsule search, filtering by active status, sorting by capsule series, and user authentication with private routing.

## Key Features

- **Capsule Collection:** Explore a comprehensive collection of SpaceX capsules, providing detailed information about each one.

- **Search Functionality:** Easily search for specific capsules within the collection, checking their availability.

- **Active Status Filtering:** Filter capsules based on their active status, allowing you to focus on either active or retired capsules.

- **Sort Capsule Series:** Sort capsules by their series in ascending or descending order, providing a flexible viewing experience.

- **User Authentication:** Secure access to certain features by implementing private routing. Only authenticated users can access restricted areas of the application.

## Frontend Technologies

- **React-Redux:** Utilized for efficient state management, ensuring a seamless user experience.

- **Redux-Thunk Middleware:** Enhances code efficiency and handles asynchronous actions.

- **React Router DOM:** Facilitates routing within the application, providing a smooth navigation experience.

- **Chakra UI Components and React Icons:** Crafted an interactive user interface with these powerful libraries, offering a visually appealing and user-friendly design.

## Backend Technologies

- **API for User Management:** Created a robust API for user login and signup, enabling user account management.

- **JSON Web Token (JWT):** Implemented JWT for secure token-based user authentication.

- **Bcrypt Password Hashing:** Employed the bcrypt library to hash and securely store user passwords in the database.

- **MongoDB Atlas:** Stored application data in the cloud with MongoDB Atlas, ensuring reliability and scalability.
